Side code project:
    Code analysis:

        -verify if the times are right is a big step too
            -see if there are ways to detect multithreading in the program

        -handle exit with no selection from jar selector better

        CSS:
            -experiment with new css files
            -make the parents of the tree table bold
            -make charts match the main gui
            -dark theme gui
            -buttons a little less white



        -Make every class as simple as possible



        -if i need to store the output data in increments
            -either files or emptying the datastruct when full then refilling

        -see if you can get garbage collecting stats
        -need to organize the tree of method calls better
            com.company.main should be under com.company

        -needs to have glossary where it explains certain things
            -what exactly overhead is
            -have in the info helper portion say that total - overall time may look wrong because the multithreading of the jvm might thread things to make them faster

        -investigate the time issue when all method calls are allowed
        -break up big classes if possible
        - i think average call should be completely redone and named average time per call / make the numbers reflect the name
        - i think the timing everywhere could be redone smarter to account for any number of possibilities
            -threading


        -on close save settings
