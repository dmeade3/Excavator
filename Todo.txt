Side code project:
    Code analysis:

        Design:
            Principles:
                Basic:
                    you can save results them or not

            Once root directory added and confirmed correct
                scan files for complexity info and other info

        look up common java performance pitfalls so my program can look for them

        General:

            make easier to use on other projects for profiling
                or at least write down process of making the project able to be profiled

            run dynamicanalysis in its own thread

            make sure label changes to running... when running

            See memory usage throughout the program

            Make simple to use, just give the jar and go, no need to compile with javassist with the outside jar

            Make scroll pane expand width wise too when scene moves

            when scrollpane grows scrollbar should stay in the same place

            make time type an enum

            add in additional scrollpane results percentage of time spent in certain places

            long complicated lines make functional out of

            on close save settings

            Index out program so it can refer to other classes:
                -each class has its own object containing all its stats

            Keeps track of line numbers and filename for user feedback for static

            make multithreaded:
                create a thread for each file / directory whichever is faster:
                    unless performance isn't an issue

            Gui columns dont sort right

            in scollpane use formatted numbers with commas

            Make the interface a gui
                -highlighting rules like that of excel green good red bad all in a range 0 -> largest number all rated by the worst info in column
                -remembers from last time so you dont have to keep retyping

            be able to save results
                -think about whether it should autocratically save the results to disk though
                    -leaning towards no
            Main things to look for:
                -Object creation
                    -especially inside a loop
                for loops
                while loops
                    -while(true)

            Each method should have a complexity score:
                -these methods are represented by objects that hold stats
                    -stats have creating new objects count
                    -loop complexity
                    -recursively goes down into other methods that are called
                    -file count
                    -method count
                    -class count
                        -can be different than filecount
                    -for loop count
                    -while loop count


        Static:
            have a "Potential Hotspot" detector
            give interesting stats on each file
            line count
            total method complexity
            individual method complexity
            for loop count
            while loop count

            popup that says possible problems


        Dynamic:
            if theres an error a popup box with only the abilty to close it should come up and display the error message
