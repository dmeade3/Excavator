Side code project:
    Code analysis:

        -need functionality to recompile the jar with javac -d  option
        - need to store the output data in increments
            -either files or emptying the datastruct when full then refilling

        -have a program start message
        -have in the info helper protion say that total - overall time may look wrong because the mltithreading of the jvm might thread things to make them faster

        -make compiling the source with javassaist my problem not the users
        -graph data in a pie graph
            -time and calls
                -make 2 graphs
        -see if you can get garbage collecting stats
        -need to organize the tree of method calls better
            com.company.main should be under com.company

        -needs to have glossary where it explains certain things
            -what exactly overhead is
        -investigate the time issue when all method calls are allowed
        -break up big classes if possible
        - i think average call should be completely redone and named average time per call / make the numbers reflect the name
        - i think the timing everywhere could be redone smarter to account for any number of possibilities
            -threading

        General:

            make easier to use on other projects for profiling
                write down process of making the project able to be profiled / try to whitle this down all i can so the process inputStream very small

            on close save settings


        Dynamic:
            if theres an error a popup box with only the abilty to close it should come up and display the error message
